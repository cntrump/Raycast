# Raycast

In this tutorial, you’ll use AVAudioEngine to build the next great podcasting app: Raycast. :]

The features you’ll implement in this app are:

- Play a local audio file.
- View the playback progress.
- Observe the audio signal level with a VU meter.
- Skip forward or backward.
- Change the playback rate and pitch.
